What's working
1. The location class is able to retrieve my location, even when offline
2. During initialization, the loading_screen creates an instance of the Location class
 a. It gets the longitude and latitude and passes it as a parameter into a String, with other params
 b. The Network helper object then takes the String and parses it into a url
 c. The http library then tries to make a response

What's not working
1. When the device is not connected, the http will report an 'Unhandled Exception'

Try
1. Putting it into a try, catch, finally block to catch the exception.
